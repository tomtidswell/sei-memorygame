## Improvements

* I added a score counter
* There is now a reset button
* I added a fixed text update box rather than an alert
* You can't select the same card twice and win
* The end of each round is detected, so no more cards can be flipped
* The cards have been randomised
* After a non-matching pair are flipped, they flip back
* Added some aces to increase the difficulty
* Added a best-score counter
* The cards now rotate to flip
