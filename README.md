# card memory game

A simple card flipping memory game. 

I built this as one of my first ever projects in JavaScript, over a weekend.

It was originally built from a guide, but I greatly enhanced the functionality. See key enhanced functionality.


## Technology
* Vanilla JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML


## Key Enhanced Functionality

* I added a score counter
* There is now a reset button
* I added a fixed text update box rather than an alert
* You can't select the same card twice and win
* The end of each round is detected, so no more cards can be flipped
* The cards have been randomised
* After a non-matching pair are flipped, they flip back
* Added some aces to increase the difficulty
* Added a best-score counter
* The cards have a rotate to flip animation


## Known Bugs
* The flip timing is slightly out

## Future Developments
* Bug fixing
* Style improvements
* General enhancement of the game
